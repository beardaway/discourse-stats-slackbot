You want to analyze your Discourse Developer Community Forum activity? Using Data Explorer plugin, utilising SQL powers to get that data? Always going to Data Explorer UI, meandering between all those queries that you created to find the one that you're looking for? Executing it and then copy pasting data to Slack to get your team aware of the numbers?

**Avoid that exhausting procedure by executing one command in your team's Slack channel!**

### Core Concept

The main concept standing behind the idea of having such tool was to save time by executing one command instead of following the path described in the intro of this repo. One command, making proper request, parsing the response and then presenting the results, that's it. **Saving time one query at a time!**
